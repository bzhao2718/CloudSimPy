there are some tensorflow v2 and v1 issues
also, need to install some extra libs like simpy

add the the absolute directory path to CouldSimPy to variable name PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=/Users/jackz/Documents/P_Macbook/Laptop/Git_Workspace/DataScience/MachineLearning/MyForks/CloudSimPy
echo $PYTHONPATH
